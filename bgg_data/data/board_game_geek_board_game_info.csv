174430,Gloomhaven,2017,1,4,120,12,"Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br/><br/>This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/e7GyV4PaNtwmalU-EQAGecwoBSI=/fit-in/200x150/pic2437871.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/lDN358RgcYvQfYYN6Oy2TXpifyM=/0x0/pic2437871.jpg,Cephalofair Games;Feuerland Spiele;Hobby World,Isaac Childres,Alexandr Elichev;Josh T.

161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1,2015,2,4,60,13,"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.<br/><br/>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.<br/><br/>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.<br/><br/>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.<br/><br/>Part of the Pandemic series<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/WI5NmPd9C3PpRvHKoP4a0Ettlao=/fit-in/200x150/pic2452831.png,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/P_SwsOtPLqgk2ScCgI2YrI9Rg6I=/0x0/pic2452831.png,"Z-Man Games;Asterion Press;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Gém Klub Kft.;Hobby Japan;Jolly Thinkers;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Lacerta;Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd;MINDOK",Rob Daviau;Matt Leacock,Chris Quilliams,20,Action Point Allowance System;Co-operative Play;Hand Management;Point to Point Movement;Set Collection;Trading;Variable Player Powers,Environmental;Medical,Strategy Games;Thematic Games,24981,8.6642,2
182028,Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization,2015,2,4,240,14,"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.<br/><br/>Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Ohqc2KTYdureA4PNjMqLXP4mUlU=/fit-in/200x150/pic2663291.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/1d2h-kr4r_9xsss2Br6iMvjR9q0=/0x0/pic2663291.jpg,Czech Games Edition;Cranio Creations;Devir;DiceTree Games;Eagle-Gryphon Games;GaGa Games;Gém Klub Kft.;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;IELLO;MINDOK;One Moment Games;Rebel,Vlaada Chvátil,Jakub Politzer;Milan Vavroň,3,Action Point Allowance System;Auction/Bidding;Card Drafting,Card Game;Civilization;Economic,Strategy Games,11527,8.64001,3
12333,Twilight Struggle,2005,2,2,180,13,"&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;<br/>&ndash; John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>Components (original edition):<br/><br/><br/>     228 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map <br/>     103 event cards <br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)<br/><br/>     260 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     110 event cards<br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews<br/>MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/>     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card decks<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/mEmeJrI3AbGTpWyeFOZnR0s_LcY=/fit-in/200x150/pic361592.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ZPnnm7v2RTJ6fAZeeseA5WbC9DU=/0x0/pic361592.jpg,GMT Games;(Self-Published);Asterion Press;Bard Centrum Gier;Chrononauts Games;Devir;DiceTree Games;MINDOK;Udo Grebe Gamedesign;Wargames Club Publishing,Ananda Gupta;Jason Matthews,Viktor Csete;Rodger B.

167791,Terraforming Mars,2016,1,5,120,12,"In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.<br/><br/>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.<br/><br/>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.<br/><br/>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br/>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br/>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br/><br/>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/yFqQ569DfL8NSTGTUw0vF9SCR7k=/fit-in/200x150/pic3536616.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/o8z_levBVArPUKI7ZrIysZEs1A0=/0x0/pic3536616.jpg,"FryxGames;Arclight;Ghenos Games;Intrafin Games;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Lavka Games;Maldito Games;Meeple BR Jogos;MINDOK;MYBG Co., Ltd.;Rebel;Reflexshop;Schwerkraft-Verlag;Stronghold Games",Jacob Fryxelius,Isaac Fryxelius,16,Card Drafting;Hand Management;Tile Placement;Variable Player Powers,Economic;Environmental;Industry / Manufacturing;Science Fiction;Territory Building,Strategy Games,23497,8.38112,5
187645,Star Wars: Rebellion,2016,2,4,240,14,"From the publisher:<br/><br/>Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players!<br/><br/>Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:<br/><br/>     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.<br/>     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.<br/><br/>Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/CoXabDwJn3dHxJaOo3GB7GOqOVE=/fit-in/200x150/pic3167731.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/v_MkttaXaur9xmghElqO4PJwwFE=/0x0/pic3167731.jpg,Fantasy Flight Games;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;Asterion Press;Delta Vision Publishing;Edge Entertainment;Galakta;Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Corey Konieczka,,12,Area Control / Area Influence;Area Movement;Dice Rolling;Hand Management;Partnerships;Variable Player Powers,Fighting;Miniatures;Movies / TV / Radio theme;Science Fiction;Wargame,Strategy Games;Thematic Games,12633,8.49377,6
120677,Terra Mystica,2012,2,5,150,12,"In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.<br/><br/>Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.<br/><br/>Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:<br/><br/><br/>    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)<br/>    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)<br/>    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)<br/>    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)<br/>    Forest (Witches, Auren)<br/>    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)<br/>    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)<br/><br/><br/>Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica.

169786,Scythe,2016,1,5,115,14,"It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br/><br/>Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).<br/><br/>Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br/><br/>Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ZpuWhZuKrFry__SY8CTRuQp35rk=/fit-in/200x150/pic3163924.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/enxCZt0Cn78-rlvmPvGtOej1ios=/0x0/pic3163924.jpg,Stonemaier Games;Albi;Arclight;Crowd Games;Delta Vision Publishing;Feuerland Spiele;Fire on Board Jogos;Ghenos Games;Maldito Games;Matagot;Morning;PHALANX;Playfun Games,Jamey Stegmaier,Jakub Rozalski,22,Area Control / Area Influence;Grid Movement;Simultaneous Action Selection;Variable Player Powers,Civilization;Economic;Fighting;Miniatures;Science Fiction;Territory Building,Strategy Games,27204,8.29987,8

173346,7 Wonders Duel,2015,2,2,30,10,"In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.<br/><br/>What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.<br/><br/>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.<br/><br/>A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/cwWMq5feF7O4O82HJOK3WE5IZ6o=/fit-in/200x150/pic3376065.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M6wL1YFgW-PsdtJ328m2QiJf1K8=/0x0/pic3376065.jpg,Repos Production;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;Asterion Press;Galápagos Jogos;Gém Klub Kft.;Kaissa Chess & Games;Lautapelit.fi;Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd;Ludicus;Rebel;Sombreros Production,Antoine Bauza;Bruno Cathala,Miguel Coimbra,15,Card Drafting;Set Collection,Ancient;Card Game;City Building;Civilization,Strategy Games,30439,8.14925,10
84876,The Castles of Burgundy,2011,2,4,90,12,"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.

115746,War of the Ring (Second Edition),2012,2,4,180,13,"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.<br/><br/>The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ScZ6Zu4wgK9JRqFWUnA89efhT-0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1215633.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/sAJOZ0c2_gZqXjn2npRgpFvshKo=/0x0/pic1215633.jpg,Ares Games;Devir;GaGa Games;Galakta;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;Planplay;Red Glove;Zhiyanjia,Roberto Di Meglio;Marco Maggi;Francesco Nepitello,John Howe;Fabio Maiorana,0,Area Control / Area Influence;Area Movement;Campaign / Battle Card Driven;Dice Rolling;Hand Management,Adventure;Fantasy;Fighting;Miniatures;Novel-based;Territory Building;Wargame,Thematic Games;Wargames,7874,8.39786,12
102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers,2013,1,7,210,12,"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/00FpWk6IN889ypSvLAo6ILUGZXw=/fit-in/200x150/pic1790789.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/xLuIh5VNsD57GXfcBox_ZF1jH4o=/0x0/pic1790789.jpg,"Lookout Games;999 Games;Crowd Games;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Gemenot;Hobby Japan;HomoLudicus;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Lacerta;Ludofy Creative;Mayfair Games;MINDOK;Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.;uplay.it edizioni",Uwe Rosenberg,Klemens Franz,6,Tile Placement;Worker Placement,Animals;Economic;Fantasy;Farming,Strategy Games,20504,8.1297,13
3076,Puerto Rico,2002,2,5,150,12,"In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles.   These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico Deluxe, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/pYFq1WbW-LIQCvWCFxjQuDC-nho=/fit-in/200x150/pic158548.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/RvdWBkmDks7AN8sodR4PyVcponA=/0x0/pic158548.jpg,"alea;Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;Broadway Toys LTD;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Kaissa Chess & Games;Lacerta;Lautapelit.fi;MINDOK;Rio Grande Games;Stratelibri;Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.;Tilsit",Andreas Seyfarth,Harald Lieske;Franz Vohwinkel,18,Variable Phase Order,City Building;Economic;Farming,Strategy Games,52137,8.06547,14
31260,Agricola,2007,1,5,150,12,"Description from BoardgameNews<br/><br/>In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/zl48oz7IeKlgWJVBLYd0nFJumdA=/fit-in/200x150/pic259085.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/L-UBO3rBOmvIrZHZLSXOypyAUPw=/0x0/pic259085.jpg,"Lookout Games;999 Games;Brain Games;Compaya.hu - Gamer Café Kft.;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Hobby Japan;Hobby World;HomoLudicus;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Lacerta;MINDOK;Smart Ltd;Stratelibri;Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.;Ystari Games;Z-Man Games",Uwe Rosenberg,Klemens Franz,32,Area Enclosure;Card Drafting;Hand Management;Variable Player Powers;Worker Placement,Animals;Economic;Farming,Strategy Games,52694,8.02612,15

Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!<br/><br/>In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.<br/><br/>No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.<br/><br/>Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...<br/><br/>The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground.

183394,Viticulture Essential Edition,2015,1,6,90,13,"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.<br/><br/>The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.<br/><br/>Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.<br/><br/>Viticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama &amp; Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as &quot;Properties&quot;), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.<br/><br/>Card Totals<br/><br/>The Viticulture Essential Edition contains 154 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/sD_qvrzIbvfobJj0ZDAaq-TnQPs=/fit-in/200x150/pic2649952.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/6KQbzbjV6HlxDZeqPwmrmR3gn6w=/0x0/pic2649952.jpg,Stonemaier Games;(Unknown);Angry Lion Games;Arclight;Feuerland Spiele;Ghenos Games;Lavka Games;Ludofy Creative;Maldito Games;Matagot,Morten Monrad Pedersen;Jamey Stegmaier;Alan Stone,Jacqui Davis;David Montgomery;Beth Sobel,0,Hand Management;Variable Phase Order;Worker Placement,Economic;Farming,Strategy Games,10871,8.17162,19

Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.<br/><br/>Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.<br/><br/>Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/JPo2K0kSzYwCSqgEFdJbCzXFaTA=/fit-in/200x150/pic2439223.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/p4IovYzLVXqxY40lbGUu92VxaIQ=/0x0/pic2439223.jpg,CMON Limited;Asmodee;Asterion Press;BoardM Factory;Crowd Games;Delta Vision Publishing;Edge Entertainment;Galápagos Jogos;Game Harbor;Guillotine Games;Portal Games;REXhry,Eric M.

124361,Concordia,2013,2,5,100,13,"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities.

25613,Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization,2006,2,4,240,12,"Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.

164153,Star Wars: Imperial Assault,2014,2,5,120,14,"Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!<br/><br/>Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/B7vdjMVow6IMf_Mo41qDJ-huZP4=/fit-in/200x150/pic2247647.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/wWTlEaPbVoUybefxFpFVTv1OU74=/0x0/pic2247647.jpg,Fantasy Flight Games;Asterion Press;Edge Entertainment;Galakta;Galápagos Jogos;Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Justin Kemppainen;Corey Konieczka;Jonathan Ying,Arden Beckwith;Christopher Burdett;Rovina Cai;Joel Hustak;Michal Ivan;David Kegg;Henning Ludvigsen;Brynn Metheney;Vlad Ricean;Ryan Valle;Ben Zweifel,7,Dice Rolling;Grid Movement;Modular Board;Partnerships;Role Playing;Variable Player Powers,Adventure;Fighting;Miniatures;Movies / TV / Radio theme;Science Fiction;Wargame,Thematic Games,14096,8.14942,25

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.<br/><br/>The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

28720,Brass: Lancashire,2007,2,4,180,14,"Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Build an industry tile<br/>    Build a rail or canal<br/>    Develop an industry<br/>    Sell cotton<br/>    Take a loan<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).<br/><br/>Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been removed.<br/>     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck slightly to ensure a consistent experience.<br/>     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.<br/>     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.<br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bY3T4SYX6lAhtfkUGJkC1laqnVw=/fit-in/200x150/pic3469216.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/l4dwCcl4Vz0r4TD-2RgQ_uoHvWM=/0x0/pic3469216.jpg,"Roxley;Warfrog Games;Crowd Games;Eagle-Gryphon Games;FRED Distribution, Inc.;Pegasus Spiele;Wargames Club Publishing;White Goblin Games",Martin Wallace,Lina Cossette;Peter Dennis;David Forest;Eckhard Freytag;Damien Mammoliti,7,Hand Management;Route/Network Building,Economic;Industry / Manufacturing;Transportation,Strategy Games,11350,8.01037,32

Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.<br/><br/>The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.<br/><br/>The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.

171623,The Voyages of Marco Polo,2015,2,4,100,12,"In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.<br/><br/>In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character and special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:<br/><br/><br/>    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.<br/><br/><br/>After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.<br/><br/>Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/HMtPzM7OaJwlKQopC5A1NC3cUUI=/fit-in/200x150/pic2461346.png,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ewdBaa31ROM_gOmpYwp4xszuAHk=/0x0/pic2461346.png,"Hans im Glück;999 Games;Albi;Arclight;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Giochi Uniti;Kaissa Chess & Games;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Piatnik;Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.;Z-Man Games",Simone Luciani;Daniele Tascini,Dennis Lohausen,15,Card Drafting;Dice Rolling;Point to Point Movement;Set Collection;Variable Player Powers;Worker Placement,Dice;Economic;Medieval;Travel,Strategy Games,12216,7.96731,39

Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Grz-qM9xwxlvQGK7B-MiljtO9pQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic860217.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/3DP_RW5lTX0WrV67s8qi8CsiXoQ=/0x0/pic860217.jpg,Repos Production;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;Asmodee;Asterion Press;Galápagos Jogos;Gém Klub Kft.;Hobby Japan;Kaissa Chess & Games;Lautapelit.fi;Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd;Rebel,Antoine Bauza,Miguel Coimbra,50,Card Drafting;Hand Management;Set Collection;Simultaneous Action Selection;Variable Player Powers,Ancient;Card Game;City Building;Civilization,Family Games;Strategy Games,60115,7.80769,40
122515,Keyflower,2012,2,6,120,12,"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.<br/><br/>In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.<br/><br/>Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/-W-BQbgQw5bUQzJ8-Qm7pL5WKiw=/fit-in/200x150/pic2278942.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/t6AnEi2l5tiHgWRjglwSfRsYy6E=/0x0/pic2278942.jpg,R&D Games;Czacha Games;Ediciones MasQueOca;FoxMind;Game Harbor;Game Salute;Gigamic;HUCH!;Quined Games,Sebastian Bleasdale;Richard Breese,Juliet Breese;Jo Breese;Gemma Tegelaers,10,Auction/Bidding;Memory;Modular Board;Pick-up and Deliver;Route/Network Building;Set Collection;Tile Placement;Worker Placement,City Building;Economic;Nautical;Renaissance;Territory Building,Strategy Games,13888,7.89731,41

146508,T.I.M.E Stories,2015,2,4,240,12,"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.<br/><br/>The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.<br/><br/>You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...<br/><br/>In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!<br/><br/><br/>Official FAQ<br/><br/><br/>Expansions were published in this order:<br/><br/>Asylum (base game) (2015)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition – Endurance (2017) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)<br/><br/>The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/LKZSyC93AhCvIKSrJH4jLGPqfNY=/fit-in/200x150/pic2617634.png,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/HgvRM7737qYJn6nFvfZ5IlSf800=/0x0/pic2617634.png,Space Cowboys;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;Asmodee;Asterion Press;Crowd Games;Hobby Japan;Rebel,Peggy Chassenet;Manuel Rozoy,Ben Carre;Vincent Dutrait;David Lecossu;Pascal Quidault,11,Co-operative Play;Dice Rolling;Role Playing;Storytelling;Time Track;Variable Player Powers,Adventure;Mature / Adult;Puzzle;Science Fiction,Thematic Games,15152,7.90895,43
233078,Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition,2017,3,6,480,14,"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.<br/><br/>No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.<br/><br/>A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/UOV5jJadzHc6ebYd5CfZXGbOWsc=/fit-in/200x150/pic3727516.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Xe0YAmobS_L0Nlo4YJgyFwOW9EM=/0x0/pic3727516.jpg,Fantasy Flight Games;Asmodee;Asterion Press;Edge Entertainment;Galakta;Galápagos Jogos;Hobby World,Dane Beltrami;Corey Konieczka;Christian T.

18602,Caylus,2005,2,5,150,12,"Once upon a time ...<br/>1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/_oLgT5QRIiBJsUqDxJvjB5p4O6U=/fit-in/200x150/pic1638795.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/90BzC8_Dgc9uDswnZsu7Qa3oHvI=/0x0/pic1638795.jpg,"Ystari Games;Brain Games;Edge Entertainment;Esdevium;hobbity.eu;Hobby Japan;HUCH!;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Lautapelit.fi;Quined White Goblin Games;Rio Grande Games;uplay.it edizioni;What's Your Game?;White Goblin Games",William Attia,Cyril Demaegd;Arnaud Demaegd;Mike Doyle (I),17,Worker Placement,City Building;Economic;Medieval,Strategy Games,23264,7.83424,45
146021,Eldritch Horror,2013,1,8,240,14,"Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br/><br/>Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/V_13CBO7zMMfQsUhF6jUAy_nAeg=/fit-in/200x150/pic1872452.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/i0zxc-H4TlTFB-yE1v4gcLy3XfY=/0x0/pic1872452.jpg,"Fantasy Flight Games;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;Arclight;Delta Vision Publishing;Edge Entertainment;Galakta;Galápagos Jogos;Giochi Uniti;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;Hobby World;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Wargames Club Publishing",Corey Konieczka;Nikki Valens,Anders Finér;David Griffith;Ed Mattinian;Patrick McEvoy;Dallas Mehlhoff;Emilio Rodriguez;Magali Villeneuve;Drew Whitmore,2,Co-operative Play;Dice Rolling;Point to Point Movement;Variable Player Powers,Adventure;Fantasy;Fighting;Horror;Novel-based,Thematic Games,20023,7.91845,46
12493,Twilight Imperium (Third Edition),2005,3,6,240,14,"Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.<br/><br/>TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from 'Puerto Rico' to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of 'Settlers of Catan', while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of 'Attack' to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.<br/><br/>Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire<br/>    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/S9-A3NyHs3hq5Y5oUpxH5iN42Aw=/fit-in/200x150/pic50404.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/oZq08Hxk1JoR-tbxiKrR7SSAMYg=/0x0/pic50404.jpg,Fantasy Flight Games,Christian T.

28143,Race for the Galaxy,2007,2,4,60,12,"In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand.

62219,Dominant Species,2010,2,6,240,14,"Game Overview<br/>90,000 B.C. &mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. <br/>Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. <br/>Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.<br/>Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. <br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. <br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.<br/>The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.<br/>Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/>Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. <br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by<br/><br/>    Dominant Species: The Card Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/30e0HaXojGXIv3Opr__gaqLu2s0=/fit-in/200x150/pic784193.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/dpHznpiPiv8biNvE_P9RCkXaOx4=/0x0/pic784193.jpg,GMT Games;Asterion Press;Filosofia Éditions;Udo Grebe Gamedesign;Wargames Club Publishing,Chad Jensen,Chad Jensen;Rodger B.

157354,Five Tribes,2014,2,4,80,13,"Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!<br/><br/>Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.<br/><br/>As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/j7n3RouVn6V-oVhyjU5NmhEOTzU=/fit-in/200x150/pic2055255.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ysxyEQPPbio1xvtx56l_8P8BkYs=/0x0/pic2055255.jpg,Days of Wonder;Asterion Press;Rebel,Bruno Cathala,Clément Masson,14,Area Control / Area Influence;Auction/Bidding;Card Drafting;Modular Board;Set Collection,Animals;Arabian;Fantasy;Mythology,Strategy Games,21614,7.80358,51

93,El Grande,1995,2,5,120,12,"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bbuF9LOZzxsmodE1ykRcEehzzl8=/fit-in/200x150/pic180538.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M3EB6PPPhdhwXaEZyr1335o_3lQ=/0x0/pic180538.jpg,Hans im Glück;999 Games;Användbart Litet Företag;Descartes Editeur;Filosofia Éditions;Gabinete Lúdico;Rio Grande Games,Wolfgang Kramer;Richard Ulrich,Doris Matthäus,4,Area Control / Area Influence;Area Movement;Auction/Bidding;Card Drafting;Hand Management;Memory;Simultaneous Action Selection,Renaissance,Strategy Games,19795,7.79229,53
163412,Patchwork,2014,2,2,30,8,"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br/><br/>In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.<br/><br/>What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.<br/><br/>Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)<br/><br/>When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/3KaofJ_Nl0a7lOFXS9PveSmQ7vE=/fit-in/200x150/pic2270442.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Z8MYZktgvGTtIikMv9HSpD_ERAI=/0x0/pic2270442.jpg,"Lookout Games;999 Games;Compaya.hu - Gamer Café Kft.;Crowd Games;Funforge;GeGe Co.

Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!<br/><br/>Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.<br/><br/>Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities.

This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony!

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br/><br/>After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game.

Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.<br/><br/>The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.<br/><br/>At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a French Plantation Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/t9mRnhW6swyL2nPSScv9iroCyZQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic3615739.png,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/RmP2yBDA0LE-ZFWrEXAkgRuYjn0=/0x0/pic3615739.png,Greater Than Games (Fabled Nexus);Intrafin Games;Pegasus Spiele,R.

216132,Clans of Caledonia,2017,1,4,120,12,"Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.<br/><br/>Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!<br/><br/>The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:<br/><br/>1. Players' turns<br/>2. Production phase<br/>3. Round scoring<br/><br/>1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.<br/><br/>2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map.

144733,Russian Railroads,2013,2,4,120,12,"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.<br/><br/>The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:<br/>- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.<br/>- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.<br/>- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.<br/><br/>The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:<br/>- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces<br/>- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.<br/>- earn 2 coins<br/>- take 2 temporary workers<br/>- jump ahead in turn order<br/>- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you<br/><br/>Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/gQy2n70lajyjsXzaBY6vWrK4z8c=/fit-in/200x150/pic1772936.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/QgRFOE3J6RK3ZfJk2qa3Xbgl0GY=/0x0/pic1772936.jpg,Hans im Glück;999 Games;Asterion Press;Bard Centrum Gier;Devir;Filosofia Éditions;Hobby World;MINDOK;Z-Man Games,"Helmut Ohley;Leonhard ""Lonny"" Orgler",Martin Hoffmann;Claus Stephan,12,Worker Placement,Industry / Manufacturing;Trains,Strategy Games,10512,7.80548,67
42,Tigris & Euphrates,1997,2,4,90,12,"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is considered Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/DNfURmGP1yPr-9H4UEFgyoxd1qA=/fit-in/200x150/pic2338267.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/vd6LHDJ-u-TkAAWafD2yG9-U974=/0x0/pic2338267.jpg,Hans im Glück;999 Games;Devir;Edge Entertainment;Fantasy Flight Games;Giochi Uniti;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;Hobby Japan;Lacerta;Matagot;Mayfair Games;Pegasus Spiele;Smart Ltd;Top Licence Games;Wargames Club Publishing,Reiner Knizia,Bascu;Christine Conrad;Doris Matthäus;Tom Thiel;Ricarda Thiel;Stephen Graham Walsh,3,Area Control / Area Influence;Hand Management;Set Collection;Tile Placement,Ancient;Civilization;Territory Building,Strategy Games,21638,7.71559,68
102680,Trajan,2011,2,4,120,12,"Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.<br/><br/>The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.<br/><br/>All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/nKAeuNIMoyIyzMilVurhLTU9Qq4=/fit-in/200x150/pic1054375.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cEaycXgp7DqVD2lORAUJ2IzgozU=/0x0/pic1054375.jpg,Ammonit Spiele;Asterion Press;FoxMind;Gigamic;Gigante Jogos;HUCH!;Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG;Maldito Games;Passport Game Studios;Quined Games,Stefan Feld,Jo Hartwig,13,Area Movement;Card Drafting;Hand Management;Set Collection,Ancient;Political,Strategy Games,11110,7.80072,69

During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot.<br/><br/>With danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system.

A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.<br/><br/>The conquest for the land of Kemet takes place over two phases: Day and Night. During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops.

34635,Stone Age,2008,2,4,90,10,"The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.<br/><br/>In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.<br/><br/>Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry.

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever &mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.<br/><br/>In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.<br/><br/>After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game.

9609,War of the Ring (First Edition),2004,2,4,120,12,"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).<br/><br/>Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.<br/><br/>The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    War of the Ring Collector's Edition<br/>    War of the Ring (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) <br/><br/>    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/8GL11pz9VU4fkWotiyPgIxTSVzc=/fit-in/200x150/pic725882.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/naKKeihI8fzCba236vxbeqbhhLI=/0x0/pic725882.jpg,Ares Games;Asmodee;Devir;Fantasy Flight Games;Fantasy Shop;Galakta;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;Nexus;Phalanx Games B.V.;Red Glove;Sophisticated Games;Tilsit,Roberto Di Meglio;Marco Maggi;Francesco Nepitello,John Howe;Matteo Macchi;Fabio Maiorana;Mizio Mencarini;Bob Naismith,6,Action Point Allowance System;Area Control / Area Influence;Area Movement;Campaign / Battle Card Driven;Dice Rolling;Hand Management,Adventure;Fantasy;Miniatures;Novel-based;Territory Building;Wargame,Thematic Games,9178,7.79682,80
161970,Alchemists,2014,2,4,120,13,"In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.<br/>Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.<br/><br/>During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Flavor text:<br/>Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.<br/><br/>But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see.

175155,Forbidden Stars,2015,2,4,180,14,"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.<br/><br/>Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order that allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eiPKhuWWez9gyN7BItPpVC94_fs=/fit-in/200x150/pic2471359.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/DWTv4PxEDiHHmgnv09t4k2WmNh8=/0x0/pic2471359.jpg,Fantasy Flight Games;Asterion Press;Edge Entertainment;Galakta;Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Samuel Bailey;James Kniffen;Corey Konieczka,,2,Area Control / Area Influence;Dice Rolling;Hand Management;Modular Board;Variable Player Powers,Bluffing;Fighting;Miniatures;Science Fiction;Wargame,Strategy Games,5037,8.0239,82
103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition),2011,3,6,240,14,"Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.<br/><br/>In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.<br/><br/>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jKVCyVKboWKMpLlI9pB9ojeqM_w=/fit-in/200x150/pic1077906.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/rCOyI5sRR9CtTaho5JJx_kFWta0=/0x0/pic1077906.jpg,"Fantasy Flight Games;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;cutia.ro;Delta Vision Publishing;Edge Entertainment;Fantasmagoria;Galakta;Galápagos Jogos;Game Harbor;Giochi Uniti;Heidelberger Spieleverlag;Hobby World;Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;Monkey Time;Stratelibri",Christian T.

185343,Anachrony,2017,1,4,120,15,"It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.<br/><br/>By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...<br/><br/>Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/gXaZPeAGVZUmNEvIaeHeELP2a10=/fit-in/200x150/pic3499707.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/HwoXcAIvX44tc_CDgcQ6I0Rztg8=/0x0/pic3499707.jpg,Crowd Games;Maldito Games;Mindclash Games,Richard Amann;Viktor Peter;Dávid Turczi,Villő Farkas;László Fejes;Laslo Forgach;Márton Gyula Kiss;Péter Meszlényi,6,Action Point Allowance System;Card Drafting;Dice Rolling;Variable Player Powers;Worker Placement,Economic;Science Fiction,Strategy Games,3762,8.16596,85
147020,Star Realms,2014,2,2,20,12,"Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).<br/><br/>Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!<br/><br/>Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>Factions<br/><br/>Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.<br/><br/><br/>Trade Federation<br/><br/>In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.<br/><br/><br/>The Blobs<br/><br/>These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.<br/><br/><br/>Star Empire<br/><br/>The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.<br/><br/><br/>Machine Cult<br/><br/>A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.<br/><br/><br/>Playing Star Realms<br/><br/>​When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.<br/><br/>As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.<br/><br/>Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/457OeNXcnwr4r_5KPj3xyltK0QI=/fit-in/200x150/pic1903816.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/XRgMJVv4YweLlANgVvxeZsQ4lm0=/0x0/pic1903816.jpg,White Wizard Games;ADC Blackfire Entertainment;ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH;Broadway Toys LTD;Devir;Games Factory Publishing;Hobby World;IELLO,Robert Dougherty;Darwin Kastle,Vito Gesualdi,11,Card Drafting;Deck / Pool Building;Hand Management;Take That,Card Game;Fighting;Science Fiction,Strategy Games,23573,7.63399,86

70149,Ora et Labora,2011,1,4,180,13,"In Ora et Labora, each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.<br/><br/>Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.<br/><br/>Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/blhNe6fZZK0HOiFtJ2OP5X_ovME=/fit-in/200x150/pic1165426.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/pXyZlviudQYPzceCgoeWm46pyc4=/0x0/pic1165426.jpg,Lookout Games;999 Games;Filosofia Éditions;Game Harbor;Hobby Japan;HomoLudicus;Lacerta;uplay.it edizioni;Z-Man Games,Uwe Rosenberg,Klemens Franz,10,Modular Board;Pattern Building;Set Collection;Tile Placement;Worker Placement,City Building;Economic;Industry / Manufacturing;Medieval;Religious;Territory Building,Strategy Games,8209,7.75936,89
148949,Istanbul,2014,2,5,60,10,"There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.<br/><br/>In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...<br/><br/>In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.<br/>    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.<br/>    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.<br/>    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.<br/>    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.<br/><br/><br/>When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends.

Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards.

126042,Nations,2013,1,5,200,14,"From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!<br/><br/>Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.<br/><br/>Gameplay introduction<br/><br/>Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a card<br/>     Deploy a worker<br/>     Hire an architect for a wonder<br/>     Special action provided by a card<br/><br/><br/>Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation.

Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.<br/><br/>Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game<br/><br/>Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>     Steam<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/kxjFY0569Y0-JEDkwa1MEkI012U=/fit-in/200x150/pic3869603.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/xeEMH5X0jBoXeY48Q5pE0JDOHP8=/0x0/pic3869603.jpg,Eagle-Gryphon Games;Winsome Games;Edge Entertainment,Glenn Drover;Martin Wallace,Kurt Miller;Paul Niemeyer;David Oram,4,Action Point Allowance System;Auction/Bidding;Card Drafting;Pick-up and Deliver;Route/Network Building;Tile Placement,Trains;Transportation;Video Game Theme,Strategy Games,9849,7.6911,95

14105,Commands & Colors: Ancients,2006,2,2,60,12,"From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C&amp;C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):<br/><br/>&quot;Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Middle Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games, Inc., Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&quot;<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/QSQGKYnD962Zt31LTPaXJNTzTVc=/fit-in/200x150/pic132447.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/NrNEpsg1hrcPtMCzaLHLLXTmdoI=/0x0/pic132447.jpg,GMT Games;Wargames Club Publishing,Richard Borg,Rodger B.

In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.<br/><br/>Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/GU81dh5VyVWiy1mHI028ALT3Gsw=/fit-in/200x150/pic3013621.png,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/rVAq1lKg98oU6tvLjERL-ZNiMfc=/0x0/pic3013621.png,Matagot;Broadway Toys LTD;Gém Klub Kft.;Lex Games;Pegasus Spiele;Pendragon Game Studio;Surfin' Meeple China,Roberto Fraga;Yohan Lemonnier,Ervin;Sabrina Tobal,9,Grid Movement;Line Drawing;Partnerships;Role Playing;Secret Unit Deployment;Simultaneous Action Selection,Deduction;Fighting;Nautical;Real-time,Party Games;Thematic Games,8382,7.73892,99

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     316 full-color die-cut counters:<br/>         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>    <br/>     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East<br/>     110 Strategy Cards<br/>     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)<br/>     Two Player Reference Cards <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted Raicer<br/>DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.<br/><br/>While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/lvuK41tyl_uF0yodcNDE2XJIho4=/fit-in/200x150/pic834645.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/8NqdhJ1Dd-m3fWXWpu5pL3YanTk=/0x0/pic834645.jpg,GMT Games;Devir;Udo Grebe Gamedesign;Wargames Club Publishing;Wydawnictwo Gołębiewski,Ted Raicer,Rodger B.
